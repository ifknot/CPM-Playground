My experiments in CP/M 8080 assembly language programming using MASM-80 on a Z80 emulator running CP/M 2.2
## RUN CP/M
This a Windows 10 emulator for a CP/M system from the 1970s or early 1980s - written by Greg at [sydneysmith.com](https://www.sydneysmith.com/wordpress/run-cpm/)

You can:
+ Start an entire computer system with one double-click.
+ Run original software in its original environment.
+ Copy files in and out of the environment (with the cpmfs tool).
+ Change disks at any point.

## MASM-80 Microsoft Utility Software:
+ MACRO-80 Assembler
+ LINK-80 Linking Loader
+ LIB-80 Library Manager
+ CREF Cross-referencing tool
